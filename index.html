      eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world
      will be.

    <h2>How Thinking About the FutureMakes Life More Meaningful</h2>
    <p>
      Humans aren’t alone in having some ability to consider the future, a
      process that scientists call “prospection.” After all, your dog gets
      excited when they see you holding a leash because they anticipate a walk
      is imminent; your cat may show similar excitement at the sound of a can
      being opened. There’s even evidence that some animals—like bonobos and
      ravens—can choose and save tools that they plan to use in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      But prospection’s unique benefits to humans extend beyond that of other
      animals. Not only do we fantasize about our next vacation or decide
      whether it would be better to take the stairs or the elevator, but our
      prospection can cast far into the future: We might save for our children’s
      education or plan for our retirement decades from now. We can make
      predictions about our own futures based on what we’ve learned about other
      people’s experiences and even from characters in books and movies. And we
      can consider multiple directions our futures might take. It is this
      remarkable ability to simulate our possible futures that makes prospection
      special. Just like gold prospecting may literally make you rich, studies
      suggest that prospecting about your future can enrich your life in at
      least four ways.

      The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last
      200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and
      it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful
      arts[3] or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).[4] The term "technology" rose
      to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial
      Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when
      American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated
      ideas from the German concept of Technik into "technology." In German and
      other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and
      technologie that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms
      as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to the study
      of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.[5] In 1937,
      the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all
      tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing,
      communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce
      and use them."[6] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today,
      especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to
      define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that
      people make and use.[7] More recently, scholars have borrowed from
      European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology
      to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on
      technologies of the self (techniques de soi). Dictionaries and scholars
      have offered a variety of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's
      Dictionary offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in
      industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems"
      and "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by
      technology."[8] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 "Real World of Technology"
      lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way
      we do things around here."[9] The term is often used to imply a specific
      field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer
      electronics, rather than technology as a whole.[10] Bernard Stiegler, in
      Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of
      life by means other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."[11]
