      The New Testament centers on the person and work of Jesus Christ. What is
      fascinating is that he claimed that the Old Testament also anticipated his
      person and work. For example, on one occasion Luke tells us of Jesus that
      “beginning with Moses and all the Prophets [i.e. the Old Testament] he
      explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself”
      (Luke 24:27). This, if true, should include these predictive prophecies
      since Moses (ca 1500 BC) and the Prophets (ca 1000 – 500 BC) were written
      hundreds of years before Jesus walked the earth. What kind of predictions
      did they make? Were they vague and subjective? Or definitive? Let’s take a
      look at the evidence.

    <h1>Isaiah Prophecies of the Servant</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and
      highly exalted. Just as many were appalled at him – his appearance was so
      disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human
      likeness – so he will sprinkle [i.e. help or heal] many nations. Isaiah
      52:13-15 (written 750 BC)

    <h1>Isaiah prophesied of Jesus crucifixion and resurrection</h1>
    <p>
      But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our
      iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his
      wounds, we are healed .. the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
      He was oppressed and afflicted .. he was led like a lamb to the slaughter
      .. by oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his
      descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living. For the
      transgression of my people, he was stricken. After the suffering of his
      soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied. By his knowledge, my
      righteous servant will justify many. (Isaiah 53: 5-11) This continues from
      the previous passage to describe the servant as being pierced for our
      transgressions. What an apt description of a person who is being nailed to
      a cross – he is being pierced. But this was written before crucifixion was
      even invented! The rest of the passage goes on to state that he was
      bearing our iniquities (sins) so that we can experience peace and healing
      in our relationship with God; that he would afterward see the light of
      life and justify many. The Good News of the early Gospel followers was
      exactly that: God is extending us his forgiveness since Jesus bore the
      penalty of our sins (through his death) and since he was resurrected we
      now have the hope of eternal life. Isaiah is anticipating not only the
      historical events around Jesus (his suffering, crucifixion & resurrection)
      but the implications of these events in our relationship with God.
